# Dual‑Clocking Method — Daily Update
**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Time (America/Chicago):** 20:21:11 CDT  
**Version Tag:** Dual‑Clocking v2025-10-29.U1

---

## Executive Summary
- We expanded the scope beyond measurement to include **productization** and a **plug‑n‑play circuit model** suitable for software integration.
- We opened a parallel track to apply our methods to **quantum sensors** (software‑assisted hardware design), focusing first on readout robustness and calibration flow.
- A **patentability white paper** with a technical + plain‑English section was requested and generated earlier today; a **PDF artifact** was produced from the exact response text for repo archiving.
- Tonight’s quick test: plug an algorithm into the **Dual‑Clocking model** and assess improvement deltas under our Drive–Probe–Drive scheme.

## Changes & Decisions (2025‑10‑29)
1) **Commercialization / IP Path**
   - Direction: Treat Dual‑Clocking as a **productizable control layer** (not only a measurement trick). Targets include SDK hooks, middleware adapters, and lab‑automation bindings.
   - Artifact: *Dual‑Clocking Patentability White Paper (2025‑10‑29)* — PDF generated from today’s full response; include unedited text to preserve legal/attribution integrity.
   - Next: Convert the white paper into a repo‑friendly `docs/` structure with `README.md`, `whitepaper.pdf`, and a `CITATION.cff` stub.

2) **Plug‑n‑Play Circuit Model**
   - Goal: A compact interface that drops into apps:  
     ```python
     dc.run(circuit, backend, mode="drive-probe-drive", corrections={"virtual": True, "physical": True}, decode="stabilizer")
     ```
   - Decision: Keep **Drive–Probe–Drive** as the default path; expose an **advanced two‑tone option** as a flag.
   - Packaging: Plan for a light `dual_clocking/` Python package with `core/`, `calibration/`, and `analysis/` modules (aligned with prior repo skeleton).

3) **Quantum Sensors Track (Software→Hardware Aid)**
   - Scope: Use Dual‑Clocking to strengthen **electrometry/thermometry** style readout and calibration routines; emphasize **mid‑circuit probes**, **decoding**, and **error‑mitigation selection**.
   - First focus: Software tools for **probe‑strength sweeps**, **back‑action vs information trade‑off**, and **auto‑selection of virtual vs physical corrections**, feeding a decoding layer.

4) **Evening Task: Drop‑In Algorithm Trial**
   - Action: Inject tonight’s candidate algorithm into the Dual‑Clocking controller and record **fidelity/latency/compression** deltas versus baseline runs.
   - Output: A short run‑log (`runs/2025-10-29/trial_01.md`) with seed, device/profile, and results table.

## Action Items
- [ ] Commit the **patentability white paper PDF** from today into `docs/dual-clocking/` (keep text unmodified).
- [ ] Add **plug‑n‑play API** surface (`dual_clocking/core/api.py`) exposing `run()`, `calibrate()`, `decode()`.
- [ ] Stand up a **sensors/** subfolder with notebooks for probe‑sweep experiments and decoding comparisons.
- [ ] Prepare **tonight’s trial run** template and minimal config (`configs/trials/2025-10-29_trial_01.yml`).

---

## Notes
- Logs should continue to use **America/Chicago** timestamps for continuity.
- Keep **virtual (Pauli‑frame)** and **physical** corrections available and **select dynamically** per run, logging decisions into the run artifact.
- Maintain strict separation between physics repos and financial/trading repos.

## Changelog Snippet
- **2025‑10‑29** – Opened productization/IP track; created patentability white paper (PDF); defined plug‑n‑play API surface; kicked off quantum‑sensors co‑design track; scheduled tonight’s algorithm‑in‑the‑loop trial under Drive–Probe–Drive default.
